# Faking the news - Sept 12


### Game and Assignments
In [this pad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/fake) ([backup document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14hP3aymW4Y-fd-MFAvhCFciP9nqYL26ty19fFuWmwCo/edit)), we're going to keep iterating on several things. Two true things and one fake thing (bold).

- Ideas aside from using videogrep directly. Getting some part of the content to make something bigger.
- Other tools aside from `pocketsphinx` for speech recognition.
- Ask for resources for word


### On previous class
- For a better understanding of the filter bubble check [WSJ's Blue Feed, Red Feed](http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/).
- In the new era (Facebook) the bubble gives you a particular information diet, based on your taste.
- In this sense, media literacy would help identifying "fake" articles, but Facebook media and Google Amp make everything look the same. For people born into Facebook to become aware of these differences, they have higher barriers to overcome.
- Planting falsehoods in Wikipedia is incredibly interesting, because of how it works and how much value people place in it
- Check "real bad answers from Google"
- Social media as a **machine to steal your attention**


### Ad targeting
If you're a content creator (media outlet) you need to crete the content and compete for the attention, while spending on advertising to capture other people.

You can iterate, you can target and get micro demographics, see how they react and polish you're information and upgrade your targeting software. That's how advertisers economy works and where the competition is actually happening.

The race for attention meets with the fact that negative news travel faster than positive news, and give you an amazing cultivation ground for fake news.

> **Social media**: A persuasion smart missile to target any micro demographic, that can be rented by anybody


### Fake News economy
> It's not fake news, it's satire.
>
> There's nothing wrong with just providing people what they want.

Getting people angry is an amazing way to get free "advertising" for free. Comments, shares and engagement is ad money.

### Project Brainstorming
The difference between **misinformation** and **disinformation** is key for the focus of the final project. Let's stay clear on the ethics discussion everywhere on our project! **The intent is critical reflection on a certain topic**.

**Jean Baudrillard** (1983), the procession of the simulacra. Photograph is a reflection on basic reality. But at the same time, it perverts the reality it shows by altering the composition. And this holds true for any kind of composition: photography, writing, research, etc.
> When the reader buys into the story, it doesn't matter if the news is fake or not, the effect it has is actually real

On the case of the Yes Men:
1. Reflection on shity
2. Perverts being the spokesman
3. Masks the lie, for the audience he IS a spokesman for the company!

(The Yes Men have 3 documentaries on the interventions they've made for 15-20 years)

Parody law is our friend! (but if you monetize is a completely different story). Look into the [four factors of fair use](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) (and it's completely subjective).

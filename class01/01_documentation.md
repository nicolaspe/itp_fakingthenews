# First fake video

[Notes on the class can be found here](https://github.com/nicolaspe/itp_fakingthenews/blob/master/class01/01_class.md)

## On class
I had several problems on class while trying to make `youtube-dl` and `videogrep` work.

Had to change ownership of several folders, as I did not have permission to write on them (how this happened is a mystery for now). Between the `brew doctor` and it's documentation file, I found the answer: `sudo chown -R $(whoami)`.

<Python not found on typical folder>
<Python command line exit>

> Several errors with ffpmeg D: Trying uninstalling and reinstalling.
chown pkg lib folder. Still not working

**Conclusions**
- `youtube-dl` needs `-f` options (at least for me)
- `videogrep` does NOT work with .3gp and .webm files

## Assignment and experimentation

#### *franken* video
This assignment is pretty straightforward.



#### Potential class project
Our creative process for the next few weeks will loosely follow **Baudrillard’s “procession of the simulacra”** (we’ll discuss in more detail next time).

To get started, please sketch a couple paragraphs on **the basic reality you want your project to reflect**. In other words, what are you interested in responding to with your fake news item—perhaps a social issue? A cultural issue? Some problem with the way we are communicating today? To take some examples from the last class:

Look into:
- [The Yes Men’s BBC hoax](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/dec/04/india.broadcasting) reflected the injustice and the basic assumption that Union Carbide would escape accountability for the chemical spill in Bhopal.
- [The Onion’s Abortionplex spoof](http://www.theonion.com/article/planned-parenthood-opens-8-billion-abortionplex-20476) reflected the readiness of some conservatives to believe that Planned Parenthood is about abortion-on-demand.

### Falsification

Reactions to VHS Hacking: ""

"Photographs furnish evidence..." Susan Sontag, "On Photograph" (1977)
It is NOT a representation of reality, it is falsifying reality. This even happened during the Soviet Union.


### Synthetic reality

We're getting used to seeing reality as synthetic. The same drivers that enable VR, AR, etc, enable a synthetic completely false reality.

*Machine learning* is being used to create realistic rendering, destroying the threshold that separates the fake from an "alternative" reality.

- **Voco** (by Adobe) is **creating** sound from scratch!!!
- **Lyrebird** even **synthesizes** sounds from a video using an algorithm!


In the future, we will be able to use computational power and machine learning to create specifically tailored content to a very molecular level!

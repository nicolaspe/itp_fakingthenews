# Faking the News - Sept 26

This class we'll use GIMP and a text-editor for creative hacking! ðŸ˜¬ Do funny and clever things

### Exercise
Clickbait your one of your "one fake, two truths".

1. one of best friends is congressman [fake]
2. **played with arcade fire in concert**
3. lived in three countries

"I had the most astonishing live festival experience... You won't believe it!!"

### Conspiracy Theories

They usually fall into misinformation (not meant to deceive people). They are a special category, as they fall into mass delusion.

**Conspiracy theory**: ""

There are certain predictors of how likely you are to believe a conspiracy theory:
- Educational level: self explanatory
- Political ideology: the more radical you are, the more likely you are to believe them!
- Collective Narcissism: Supremacists, people who believe their race/community is superior

The role of fear, uncertainty and fear of change.

The more you engage with these material, even if you know it is not true, the more your brain is inclined to believe it.

But... some of these theories have been confirmed true! The Gulf bombardment, MKUltra, etc...

**Basic Law of Rumor**: R = I * A
- *R* - rumor strength
- *I* - importance of the subject
- *A* - ambiguity of the evidence

The more transmission, the more power a rumor has!

**David Ike**, created the theory about reptilians, that aliens control us broadcasting signals through the rings of Saturn (inspiration TV movie, *V*).

Conspiracy theories are old as time itself. But their weaponization, is something newer.
-> Information hygiene?

How do we fix this? Education? Government provided tools?

Fake leaks create great opportunities for believability.

### Assignment

1. Polish your final project - project brainstorming + questionnaire
2. Create a **hoax** - just a small fake will be enough! Download the entire webpage to edit the portion needed with the false bit of news.

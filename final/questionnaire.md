### Concept
1. What basic reality does your project reflect?
	- It wants to reflect on the underlying homophobia, bigotry and misogyny of these ultra conservative religious groups and their choices.
2. What basic reality does your project mask or pervert?
	- It perverts their paranoia that the LGBT groups want to destroy their world
3. Does your project mask the absence of a basic reality?
	- There is a conspiracy against the Church, an underlying battle for the control of humanity. No one is safe, and they have managed to
	- For some the satire will be a truthful phenomena
4. Does your project bear relation to any reality whatsoever?
	-


### Intent
1. Tools used, with justification
	- As a main account, to deliver information: fake Twitter (& Facebook) account + blog to post the news? (I'd prefer not to... Rumor information spreads more if we state that it's ephemeral and could be "taken down")
	- Twitter bots to spread information
		- Checking **influencers**, WHO I WANT TO REACH?!?!
			- Infiltrate their groups?
			- Tweet at them?
		- Trying to figure out on who I'm trying to reach
		- Create a hashtag
		- Probably a grassroots, mischief!
	- Means to alter a video & images to spread "leaks"
2. Data collection and measurement (if appropriate)
	- Twitter engagement data? Images linked to a server to measure engagement
	- At the end of the experiment?... what do I want to say??
3. Ethical risks and mitigation
	- It is a form of activism
	- it will be a clear satire. The name of the organization will be a translation for satire, joke or something similar
4. Legal risks and mitigation
	- I will put html comments and watermarks stating that everything is a joke. If someone looks for it, it will clearly link to this questionnaire


### Justification
1. Why are you interested/excited/compelled to pursue this project?
	- The bigotry of these groups is a hard problem to solve. Religion has a strong grip on their realities, and one of the most effective ways to affect them and create a reflection on what they believe is to do it from the inside. Hopefully, I will manage to stir their pot. Otherwise, at least I will get a good laugh.
	- Demonstrating people's psychological biases

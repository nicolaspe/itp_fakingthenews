# Anti HomoHoax

### Metadata
1. Your name / major / year
	- Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier / ITP / First year - Fall 2017
2. Project working title
	- Conservative homosexualization
3. Tweet-length project description
	- Satire on the fears of ultra conservative Chilean groups, with mixed political messages. The population cannot be homosexualized!
4. Paragraph-length project description
	- A fake conservative hacking group "came across" with new information regarding the Chilean politics and the advancement of the "Gay Dictatorship" movement. Through fake satirical news, I will explore how their own biases affect their perception of reality. At the same time, I will "attack" some forms of their daily lives with these fake news (brands that have connections to the "Gay Lobby", underground political compromises, etc).


### Concept
1. What basic reality does your project reflect?
	- It wants to reflect on the underlying homophobia, bigotry and misogyny of these ultra conservative religious groups and their choices.
2. What basic reality does your project mask or pervert?
	- It perverts their paranoia that the LGBT groups want to destroy their world
3. Does your project mask the absence of a basic reality?
	- There is a conspiracy against the Church, an underlying battle for the control of humanity. No one is safe, and they have managed to
	- For some the satire will be a truthful phenomena
4. Does your project bear relation to any reality whatsoever?
	- What is a satire and a joke for some, is the truth for others


### Intent
1. Tools used, with justification
	- As a main account, to deliver information: [fake Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sfuerzaconserva). Rumor information spreads more if we state that it's ephemeral and could be "taken down"
		- Check **influencers**, WHO DO I WANT TO REACH?!?!
			- Infiltrate their groups?
			- Tweet at them?
		- Create a hashtag
		- Start influencing and tweeting at people from the bottom
	- Means to alter a video & images to spread "leaks"
2. Data collection and measurement (if appropriate)
	- Twitter engagement data
	- Images linked to a server to measure engagement
3. Ethical risks and mitigation
	- It is a form of activism
	- It will be a clear satire. The name of the organization will be a translation for satire, joke or something similar
4. Legal risks and mitigation
	- I will put html comments and watermarks stating that everything is a joke. If someone looks for it, it will clearly link to this questionnaire


### Justification
1. Why are you interested/excited/compelled to pursue this project?
	- The bigotry of these groups is a hard problem to solve. Religion has a strong grip on their realities, and one of the most effective ways to affect them and create a reflection on what they believe is to do it from the inside. Hopefully, I will manage to stir their pot.
	- To demonstrating people's psychological and political biases.
	- Otherwise, at least I will get a good laugh.
